### 1. Prologue
Scene. Inside the castle of Fyrslim, Davidus comes down the stairs, holding a sword in his hand.

**Davidus**

O, foul people,

There is even no hiding space for your soul in this spacious room.

Sin, sin has brought you here;

In this moist, cold place!

May the Lord have mercy on your souls, my friends.

### 2. Parodos

[Chorus comes in]

**Chorus**

Men of sin,

Who has made you adhesive?

Ancient prophecies, will be fulfilled, be fulfilled!

[Chorus jumps like slimes]

Forgive me, forgive me!

Great Lord!

[Chorus goes]

### 3. First Episode
[Slimes come in]

**Davidus**

Please forgive me, my friends.

And do not curse me in the sulfurous sea.

Blame not me but this cursed room.

I must eliminate all of you.

[Davidus defeats Slimes, and Slimes goes]

### 4. First Stasimon

[Chorus comes in]

**Chorus**

O, valiant knight, son of George.

Lead us out of this misfortune!

Let the earth be filled with vitality.

Let the people be free from starving.

It’s coming, come quickly,

I hear the footsteps of Ereshkigal,

It’s in the room ahead!

[Chorus goes]

### 5. Second Episode

**Davidus**

The great god of wisdom, I am Davidus, son of George.

Have mercy on me yet, so that I may pass 

through this dark labyrinth.

I will save Fyrslim, 

Please guide me on the right path.

[Davidus comes out form the labyrinth]

### 6. Second Stasimon

[Chorus comes in]

**Chorus**

Darkness! Darkness makes people weak.

Fearless Davidus,

You have crossed this dreadful labyrinth.

This further proves your qualification to be the new king.

Please ignore that ominous prophecy,

Let evil vanish from this land!

[Chorus leaves]

### 7. Third Episode

[George comes in, and Mestierin comes in]

**George**

O, Davidus, my son.

Are you truly going to point your sword at your father?

It will weigh your soul down and numb your heart.

You still have a chance to escape before committing irreparable acts.

**Davidus**

George, my father, the culprit who made this country cursed.

The messenger has brought back a prophecy from the Lord, please believe,

A king tainted with sins made this land cursed.

[Davidus defeats George, George goes]

### 8. Third Stasimon

[Chorus comes]

**Chorus**

Victory! The goddess of victory

cries out from the mountaintops.

This shall be the end of darkness,

The dreadful prophecy is but a lie.

Dawn, our dawn is here!

[Chorus leaves]

### 9. Exodos

**Davidus**

My soul has become heavy, my heart numb.

Oh heavens, this intense guilt.

My Lord, please forgive me for my terrible behavior.

Wasn’t I noble from the beginning? 

[Davidus goes in screaming]

## Extra I

O brave knight.

Why art thou buried in these viscous creatures?

May your soul rest in peace.

[Chorus leaves, Slimes leaves]

# 8. Third Stasimon

[Chorus comes]

**Chorus**

O, how dreadful the scene is.

Son killing father, father killing son.

Such tragedy has occurred, 

A heavy sin is born!

This country shall never know peace!

[Chorus leaves]

### 9. Exodos

**George**

Davidus, my son.

In this predetermined destiny, you have gained nothing.

You are not yet willing to bear this sin.

[George leaves, Mestierin leaves]
